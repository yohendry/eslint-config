**ESLint Configuration**
=====================

This is my personal ESLint configuration, which I use to keep my JavaScript code tidy and consistent.

**Why Use ESLint?**

As a developer, I believe that writing clean, readable, and maintainable code is crucial. ESLint helps me achieve this by enforcing coding standards and best practices in my
projects.

**What's Included?**

This configuration includes:

* A set of rules for JavaScript syntax errors
* A set of best practice rules to keep your code organized and consistent
* Some custom rules I've added based on my personal preferences

**How to Use This Configuration**

To use this ESLint configuration, simply clone or download the repository and add it to your project's root directory. Then, create a `.eslintrc.json` file in the same
directory with the following contents:

```json
{
  "extends": "path/to/personal-eslint-configuration/.eslintrc.json"
}
```

Replace `path/to/personal-eslint-configuration` with the actual path to this repository.

**Why Not Just Use a Default Configuration?**

While there are many great default ESLint configurations out there, I wanted to create my own based on my specific needs and preferences. By using my own configuration, I can
ensure that it's tailored to my coding style and project requirements.

**License**

This ESLint configuration is released under the MIT license, which means you're free to use it however you like, as long as you include a copy of this README in your
repository.

**Acknowledgments**
